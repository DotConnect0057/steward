# steward

steward is a tool designed to simplify the management of Linux systems, whether standalone or in a cluster. It provides a unified solution for configuration, package management, status monitoring, and more. With a declarative approach at its core, Steward ensures consistency and reliability, while also supporting procedure-based management for tasks that require step-by-step execution.

steward is intended to simulate common package management like npm, go mod into linux management.
